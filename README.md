### Overview:
Firstly we analysed our dataset and pointed out factors on basis of whom we could profile our customers. Age, gender and type of customers were the three facotrs. We drilled down on the Age factor, and using an overview we realised how our customers are spread.

### Age Groups 20-60 Analysis Part 1:
Through overview it is quite evident that most of our customer groups are in the range of 21 to 60 years old. Hence we need to make sure as an airline compnay that our most frequent customers are the most satisifed. We looked at leg room and how that affected the satisafaction of our customers.
